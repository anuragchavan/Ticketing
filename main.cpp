/*-----------------------------------------------
* This C++ program computes the total ticket sales of a concert.
* There are three types of seatingâ€™s:  A, B, and C.
* The program accepts the number of tickets sold and the price of a ticket for each of the three types of seats.
* The program allows the user to re-run or quit after invalid input or successful completion 

Formulae use -
Total Sales = Price of Ticket * Quantity of Tickets sold

Each Seating Type consists of a header file and a cpp file
